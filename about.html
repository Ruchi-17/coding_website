<center><h3>People can become developers from almost any background, 
    whether they started programming at an early age and 
    majored in computer science (CS), or they taught 
    themselves how to code later in life. The good thing we 
    focus on how we went from being beginning coders to getting that first job.
The Learn Programming subreddit is a great place to start if you're hoping to 
become a developer beginning at square one. The community offers a lot of 
encouragement and resources. This post describes a four-month journey from 
knowing barely any programming syntax to learning several languages and getting 
paid to do freelance work. It's full of tips and encouragement for beginning 
developers, along with a bunch of additional helpful comments from the community. 
There are plenty of other stories like this one on r/learnprogramming, including a 
short account about learning to program in one's thirtiesâ€”just in case you thought 
it was too late (it never is).</h3></center>
